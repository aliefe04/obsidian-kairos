# Changelog

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — not yet released

The first version. It is built and tested on this machine against Obsidian 1.13.7, but it is not in
the community plugin directory yet.

### Added

- **Reminder syntax from the note itself.** A bare time in a date-scoped note
  (`- [ ] msg to dentist 09:00`) alerts at that time on that note's date. Start-of-line times, `at`
  prefixes, explicit `@ 2026-09-11 09:00` forms, and the existing `⏰` and `(@…)` forms of other
  plugins are read as well.
- **The date cascade**: frontmatter, H1, nearest preceding date heading, file name formats including
  `YYYY/DD-MM-YYYY-dddd`, and the Daily Notes folder cross-check. An ambiguous file name such as
  `08-09-2026` is refused and reported instead of guessed.
- **A scheduling engine** with one recomputed next-wake timer, deterministic instance identity,
  a per-device lease with fencing, a 60-second dedupe window, and per-reminder catch-up policy.
- **Two severities**: `alarm` interrupts, `digest` batches at a configured window. Quiet hours fold
  alarms into the next digest.
- **Delivery channels**: desktop OS notification with an alert window (Done, Snooze, Open note), ntfy
  server-side scheduled push, and an RFC 5545 `.ics` export for a calendar application.
- **A searchable settings tab** using the Obsidian 1.13 declarative settings API.
- **An agenda view**: today, tomorrow, the next seven days, and overdue.
- **Commands**: open agenda, add reminder, rescan vault, copy diagnostics, test notification.
- **Locale packs** for `en` and `tr`, as data files rather than a dependency.
- **A real-application test harness** (`npm run smoke`) that drives Obsidian over the Chrome DevTools
  Protocol and asserts the parsed schedule, the exactly-once guarantee, and the rendered alert text.

### Security

- No telemetry, no account, no server component.
- The default push payload is the task title alone. The note name is opt-in and the vault path is
  never sent.
- Channel tokens are stored as plaintext in `data.json`, because Obsidian exposes no secret storage
  API. This is stated in the settings tab and in the README.

### Known limits

- Obsidian mobile cannot alert while the app is closed. This is a platform limit. The `.ics` and push
  tiers cover it; see `docs/delivery.md`.
- A push provider holds a scheduled alert for a bounded period. On `ntfy.sh` the maximum is three
  days, which is why the registration horizon defaults to three days. A user who runs their own server
  with a larger limit can raise it in the settings.
- Recurrence (`🔁`) is read for display and never advanced. Tasks and Reminder own that field.
- The performance target for large vaults (10,000 notes under 1.5 seconds) is a target, not yet a
  measurement. The benchmark is a Phase 1 item.
